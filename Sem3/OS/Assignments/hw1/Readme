Results can be found in the data/c* files which is the output for a run with
5 consumers and a buffer size of 50. The graphs can be found in the graphs.xls or
graphs.pdf. 

I did a large number of tests. At varying sleep lengths, ultimately settling on 
eight seconds. Based on my graphs both variables are linear in nature. Fitting
the Buffer_size Vs. Probability data to a linear model gives me a function of roughly: 
	probabilty =  1.5 - .02*size.

The data for Number of Consumers Vs. Probability was tested with a buffer size of 45. 
The decision to pick 45 as opposed to 40 came down to testing both for ten trials.
45 resulted in 5 deadlocks and 40 resulted in 8, 

Its model is roughly:
	probability = -0.15 + .1*Consumers

This is the POSIX implementation of the assignment. I found the POSIX api 
was significantly less "magical" then the System V api. The idea of creating
a file and then mapping it to each processes memory space is much more intuitive. 

My only issues with setting up the region were the correct order of operations in
it's creation and linking. For reference:

Creation/Linking:

	Producer: 					Consumer:
	-------- 					--------
	shm_open 					shm_open
	ftruncate 					mmap	
	mmap

Removal:
	shm_unlink 					munmap	
	munmap
		

I had a strange non-error in my program that I feel should have catastrophically
failed. Line 51 of consumer.c the line used to be:
		donuts[i][0] = p_data->p_flavors[cdonut][p_data->p_out[i]]; 

The variable 'i' ranges from 0 to 119, p_data->p_out can only index from 0 to D_SIZE.
So I feel like I should have had a Seg Fault somewhere.
