Assignment 3:

Degree of success: 100%

Once learning about the nessessary functions for creating semephores and shared memory
this assignment became very easy. My only issues were as follows:
	1. My mutex semaphore was initially set to 0, where it should have been 1. 
	2. I miswrote what should have been the temp variable j as i, causing my values randomly
	   show up as negatives or massive. 
	3. Had trouble formatting my graphs in libreoffice.

My graphs are stored in the Graphs.ods file, which was created in libreoffice. Should you
be unable to read the file the Data I collected for the graphs are as follows:
(Each iteration is run with 5 loops)


Table 1:
Number of Slots  |  10  |  25  |  40  |  50  |  60  |  75  |  100
Deadlocks        |   5  |   4  |   2  |   2  |   0  |   0  |    0

Table 2:
Number of Consumers | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 
Deadlocks           | 0 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 3
